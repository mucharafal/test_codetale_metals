    "body": "Agree with Sean here - there's not a really obvious use case for having this independent of the class where it's used. Putting it into the code means that the whitelist feature is self-documenting, and you don't have to go through any indirection to find this file. \r\n\r\nPlus I think moving this into SparkFunSuite means you can get rid of the file loading logic in 'object SparkFunSuite'.",
