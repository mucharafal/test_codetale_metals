    "body": "@andrewor14: don't let me forget to port this suite's tests into the new MemoryManagerSuite (or maybe a new suite that's named to reflect the fact that it tests division of execution memory among tasks). Thanks to the TaskMemoryManager refactoring, I'm hoping that we can simplify the test code somewhat by using Futures instead of threads, since we won't need to set thread locals anymore.\n",
