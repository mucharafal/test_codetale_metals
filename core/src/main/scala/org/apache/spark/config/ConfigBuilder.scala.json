    "body": "Sure - maybe move that into internal.config.\n\nWe have been creating top-level packages in ad-hoc ways and those are really polluting the docs. I'm trying to cut down those. The big chasm is that as developers, we only think about the structure of the project as a developer of the project. However, what we should really be thinking about is from the end-user's perspective.\n",

What's the new convention for adding new private Spark types to the code base?\n\nEverything here is `private[spark]`, except for the package objects which Scala doesn't allow being `private` anything. So what would show up in the docs here and potentially confuse people?\n",

    "body": "> private[spark] has no impact on java\n\nAt what level? Yes, the method in the java class file is public, but it doesn't seem to actually show up in any documentation. e.g. in http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/java/index.html you don't see things like `SparkConf.validateSettings`, which is `private[spark]`.\n\nI don't like putting things in specially-named packages in hope that people will not look at them, but if it means I can get this change moving, I'll move classes into whatever package.\n",
