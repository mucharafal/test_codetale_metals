    "body": "I found this a little hard to grok. The meat of this seems to be that basically this assumes it only sees events from one application. What about something like:\n\n```\nThis listener expects to hear events from a single application only. If events from multiple\napplications are seen, the behavior is unspecified.\n```\n\nThen even if this implementation evolves to actually track stuff using the other events, you've already made a general carve-out in the javadoc with the high level assumption.\n\nAlso it's better to just leave behavior unspecified for invalid inputs than to guarentee some implementation-specific behavior (unless this is a case you expect to see in normal operation).\n",
