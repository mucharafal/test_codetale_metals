    "body": "This is just an aside, and not something that needs to change here, but I see a lot of \"constants\" declared in the code base within a `class`, which makes them non-static members. They'd be appropriate in a companion object. It's harmless here as it just adds a few more fields to an object that might be instantiated a few times, but might be a waste of memory elsewhere. Leave it here. I may have a look at other occurrences to see if any are an actual problem.\n",
