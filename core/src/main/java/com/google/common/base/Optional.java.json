That's not quite true\nfor BSD or MIT licenses.\n\nThe copyright owner doesn't matter; there are hundreds of them. It matters\njust how whoever they are license their IP to be used.\nOn Aug 11, 2014 12:22 AM, \"Matei Zaharia\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> In core/src/main/java/com/google/common/base/Optional.java:\n> \n> > @@ -0,0 +1,243 @@\n> > +/*\n> > - \\* Copyright (C) 2011 The Guava Authors\n> \n> Shouldn't we still list it in our LICENSE?
