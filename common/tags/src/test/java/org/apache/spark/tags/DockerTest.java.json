    "body": "If you search through the commit history, I'm pretty sure that we originally tried running those DockerTests on RISELAB Jenkins but ran into problems with the Docker Daemon becoming unstable under heavy build load. This should be fixed in the newer-generation Ubuntu build workers, but we haven't quite finished migrating the PRBs onto those.\r\n\r\nGiven this, my hunch is that those tests aren't running anywhere right now, which isn't great. I think they're primarily used for testing JDBC data source SQL dialect mappings. It's been a year or more since I last looked into this, though, so I might be misremembering.",
