    "body": "In the long run, we should define a `statistics` interface in `Expression`, so that we can propagate the column stats more naturally, for more cases(not only `Alias`, but also `Add`, `Mod`, etc.). But currently catalyst doesn't propagate attributes correctly, e.g. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-17995 (`Union`, `Except`, etc. has the same problem), we may need to hack a lot of places to propagate column stats correctly.\r\n\r\nAccording to @wzhfy 's benchmark, it turns out we can speed up most of the cases if we take care of `Alias`, so I'm ok with the current approach.",
