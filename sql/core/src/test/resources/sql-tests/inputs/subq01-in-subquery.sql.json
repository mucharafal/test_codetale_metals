    "body": "One reason we put the serial number in is we think when the number of files in the same group grows, we don't need to count how many they are with a command like this: `ls -1 subq-* | wc -l`. So it's a trade-off of having two extra numbers at the creation time versus counting the files. The number of files could grow to a few tens in the future (well, I don't anticipate we have more than 99 files in a group).\r\n\r\nI am open to any suggestions though. If the consensus is to drop the serial number, I really have no problem changing that. ",
