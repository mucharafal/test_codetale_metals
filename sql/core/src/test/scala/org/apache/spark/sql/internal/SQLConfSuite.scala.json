    "body": "I think it will be a forward-slash because this will have to be a URI in any event in order to work on Windows. (The reason it's there is because the URI of a local directory will resolve with a trailing slash if the JDK knows the directory exists, otherwise it will be left as-is. The default URI won't have a trailing slash because it doesn't find the directory; it will exist at this point in the test though. Both are equally fine for Spark's purposes but that's why this exists in the test, for the record.)\n",
