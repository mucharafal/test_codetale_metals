    "body": "Context for other reviewers: this test fails because it creates a new SparkContext which conflicts with the global TestSQLContext.  The test in question needs to run with `local-cluster` mode (to avoid some optimizations made for broadcast variables in the driver), which is why we can't re-use the global TestSQLContext. As a result, this test is commented out until we figure out how to eliminate the global TestSQLContext or otherwise provide hooks for managing its lifecycle.\n\n@andrewor14, if we had a way to stop and restart the global TestSQLContext then we might be able to use that here: before we create the new context, stop the global one, and restore the global one at the end of the test.  This is a little bit hacky but may be better than what we have now.  Only subtlety here may relate to other global classes, such as TestData.\n\n/cc @rxin, who maybe has some suggestions for quick-fixes here.\n",
