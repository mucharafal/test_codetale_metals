    "body": "Yeah, I wasn't totally sure about that either.  I started off with the tests in another branch I wasn't going to include in the PR, just to make sure I'd done everything correctly.\r\n\r\nI eventually came to the conclusion that they are useful.  I think of it more in terms of preventing regressions; they should prevent a FunSuite dependecy creeping back in to SharedSparkSession.\r\n\r\nFor similar reasons, I should probably put similar tests in for SharedSparkContext.",
