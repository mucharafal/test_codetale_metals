    "body": "For the table metadata, I think we do need partitions. Iceberg creates partitioned tables and I'd like to start getting the DDL operations working. This is why I proposed this [metadata in the SPIP](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zLFiA1VuaWeVxeTDXNg8bL6GP3BVoOZBkewFtEnjEoo/edit#heading=h.7vhjx9226jbt) a few months ago.
