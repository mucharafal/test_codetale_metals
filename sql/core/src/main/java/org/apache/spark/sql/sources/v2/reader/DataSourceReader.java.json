Does this mean developers should produce `InternalRow` here for each partition? `InternalRow` is under catalyst and not meant to be exposed.",

    "body": "The rationale is, data source v2 is not stable yet, and we should make it usable first, to make more people implement data sources and provide feedback. Eventually we should design a stable and efficient row builder in data source v2, but for now we should switch to `InternalRow` to make it usable. `Row` is too slow to implement a decent data source (like iceberg).",
