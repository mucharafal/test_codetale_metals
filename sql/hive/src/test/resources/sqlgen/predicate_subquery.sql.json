Please note that it's not a repetition by duplicated ID and happens as a direct double nesting. I think it's okay.\n\n``` sql\nSELECT `gen_attr_0` AS `a`\nFROM (SELECT `gen_attr_0`\n      FROM (SELECT `a` AS `gen_attr_0`\n            FROM `default`.`t1`\n           ) AS gen_subquery_0\n      WHERE EXISTS(SELECT `gen_attr_1` AS `a`\n                   FROM (  (SELECT `gen_attr_1`\n                            FROM (SELECT `a` AS `gen_attr_1`\n                                  FROM `default`.`t1`\n                                 ) AS gen_subquery_2\n                           ) AS gen_subquery_1\n                        ) AS gen_subquery_1\n                   )\n     ) AS b\n```\n",
