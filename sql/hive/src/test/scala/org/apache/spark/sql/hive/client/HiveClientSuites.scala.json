    "body": "No test coverage has been lost. `HiveClientSuite` is not a good name for that class. It actually just tests partition filtering. I added a `TODO` suggesting we rename it to `HivePartitionFilteringSuite`, but that makes the diff difficult to grok. All other Hive client testing is still in `VersionsSuite`, and that suite still tests all supported Hive versions. I wanted to change the names of these tests to make them clearer, but it resulted in a jumbled diff. You requested that I keep the names as-is to make the diff clearer.\r\n\r\nI added \"TODO\" comments suggesting better names for these classes, for renaming later.",
