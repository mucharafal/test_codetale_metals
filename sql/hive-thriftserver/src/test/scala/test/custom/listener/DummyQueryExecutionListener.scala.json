    "body": "There's a sort of weird Scala trick you can use to avoid these two source files. Just to this in the test suite source file:\r\n\r\n```\r\npackage __root__.test.custom.listener {\r\n  \r\n  class DummyQueryExecutionListener { ...\r\n    \r\n  }\r\n  \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen the test source is more self-contained, and you can attach the comment about the package name to the package declaration.",

    "body": "Nice trick. I guess Spark respects package = directory most of times so place them to new directory intuitively. Given we seem to allow exceptions for such like this case, I'll apply the trick. Thanks!",
