    "body": "I love that you've made it so easy to visualize the output, but this now adds a \"dependency\" on matplotlib which isn't used anywhere else in PySpark AFAIK. Strictly, because PySpark doesn't currently use formal package management (e.g. through PyPi), this isn't really adding a dependency, and it's just an example. But might be safer to just use a line note showing how the output can be visualized with matplotlib. Curious what others think. cc @davies\n",
