You can take a look at `./docs/ml-features.md` which includes this file to see how its used in markdown and the generated website documentation at http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-features.html#binarizer .\n\nThe instructions for building the docs locally are located at `./docs/README.md` - let me know if you need any help with that - the documentation build is sometimes a bit overlooked since many of the developers don't build it manually often.\n",
