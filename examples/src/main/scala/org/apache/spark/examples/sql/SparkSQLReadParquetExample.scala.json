    "body": "Can you use the existing `SparkSQLExample` for this? Seems overkill to add a new example just so you can run it in the k8s tests.\r\n\r\nI was hoping there was something simple like setting `spark.io.compression.codec=snappy`, but I'm not sure SparkPi would actually hit that. (Maybe `SparkRemoteFileTest`, which is run already, does, though?)\r\n\r\nIf the above doesn't work, or `SparkSQLExample` is too slow or doesn't work for this, then I think in this case it's better to skip the test until we can separate examples from k8s integration tests.",
