    "body": "I'm not sure the `source` will work correctly given the way we encourage users to run example programs. If you see the `Running examples` section at http://people.apache.org/~pwendell/spark-releases/latest/index.html you can see that we ask users to run example programs with something like `./bin/spark-submit examples/src/main/r/data-manipulation.R`. \n\nSo I'd just recommend merging all the code into one file `data-manipulation.R` and then take in the CSV file name as a command line argument. \n",
