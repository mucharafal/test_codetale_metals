Metals is developed at the\n+[Scala Center](https://scala.epfl.ch/) and [VirtusLab](https://virtuslab.com)\n+with the help from [Lunatech](https://lunatech.com) along with contributors from\n+the community.\n+\n+## TL;DR\n+\n+Check out [https://scalameta.org/metals/](https://scalameta.org/metals/), and\n+give Metals a try!\n+\n+- Sbt script support with hover, completions and go to definition.\n+- Scala 3 worksheet support\n+- Scala 0.25.0 and 0.26.0-RC1 support.\n+- Main classes from dependencies can now be run\n+\n+## Sbt script support\n+\n+Thanks to the great work by [dos65](https://github.com/dos65) Metals now\n+supports Sbt script files as well as build's Scala files.\n+\n+This includes in addition to already existing features:\n+\n+- hover\n+- completions\n+- go to definition\n+- parameter hints\n+\n+The full list of supported features is available\n+[here](../docs/editors/overview.html#additional-file-types).\n+\n+Sbt support is is achived by generating additional `metals.sbt` file for each\n+level of Sbt's project. For `build.sbt` we now generate\n+`project/project/metals.sbt`, for `project/other.sbt`\n+`project/project/project/metals.sbt` etc. This is needed for the Bloop plugin to\n+generate proper information in `.bloop` configuration files. It's recommended to\n+gitignore `metals.sbt` and `.bloop` anywhere in the file tree.\n+\n+## Scala 3 worksheet support\n+\n+Finally, it is possible to run worksheets for Scala 3 starting with version\n+0.26.0-RC1. To try it out users need to create the worksheet inside of a Scala 3\n+source directory and can use it the same way as with previously supported\n+worksheets.\n+\n+This is a great place for anyone to experiment with Scala 3 and see what is\n+coming around the corner!\n+\n+![worksheet-sample](https://i.imgur.com/DZvz3Le.gif)\n+\n+## Running main classes from dependencies\n+\n+Previously, users could only run main classes that are defined in the source\n+code, which made it impossible to run and debug in certain frameworks such for\n+example [Play Framework](https://www.playframework.com/). Metals now searches\n+the classpath additionally to find any classes that are defined by the user and\n+not available in the main sources.\n+\n+To run any such class a full name needs to be provided via the configuration.\n+\n+For example in Visual Studio Code this would look like this:\n+\n+```json\n+{\n+  \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\n+  \"configurations\": [\n+    {\n+      \"type\": \"scala\",\n+      \"request\": \"launch\",\n+      \"name\": \"Play main\",\n+      \"mainClass\": \"play.core.server.ProdServerStart\",\n+      \"buildTarget\": \"root\",\n+      \"args\": [],\n+      \"jvmOptions\": []\n+    }\n+  ]\n+}\n+```\n+\n+In other editors users need to provide the same parameters for the run\n+configuration.\n+\n+## Miscellaneous\n+\n+- Removed breakpoints are no longer hit.\n+- Compilation is invoked only once for any change.\n+- Worksheets now display types next to the code.\n+- Fixed wrong completions in string interpolation.\n+- Bloop now copies old artifacts by default even if workspace does not compile."
