See https://github.com/scalacenter/bloop/issues/1134 for details\r\n```\r\nIssue is still open but was assigned 4 days ago, maybe it is worth just doing `Left(d.getCode)` ? (more complex as it is java and must handle null, but concept the same)\r\nThis way when you update conversion bsp->lsp it will be pushed to client.\r\n\r\nWhat is this code for is actually a good question anyway.",

Since on the metals side we aren't using `code` for anything (again as far as I can tell), do you think it might be best to leave it out for now and first implement it if needed when there when it's finished and concrete just to ensure we don't have to potentially make the changes for the current case, and then change them again later? I'd rather just do that once. ",
