Non-reserved keywords have a\r\nspecial meaning only in particular contexts and can be used as identifiers (e.g., table names, view names,\r\ncolumn names, column aliases, table aliases) in other contexts. Reserved keywords can't be used as\r\ntable alias, but can be used as other identifiers.\r\n\r\nThe list of reserved and non-reserved keywords can change according to the config\r\n`spark.sql.parser.ansi.enabled`, which is false by default.\r\n```",
