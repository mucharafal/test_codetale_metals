When creating a table using `partitoned by` clause, partitions are generated and registered in the Hive metastore. However, if the partitioned table is created from existing data, partitions are not registered automatically in the Hive metastore. User needs to run MSCK REPAIR TABLE to register the partitions. `MSCK REPAIR TABLE` on a non-existent table or a table without partitions throws an exception. Another way to recover partitions is to use `ALTER TABLE RECOVER PARTITIONS`."
