    "body": "There's probably more we can or should add, given the number of deprecations and removals in 3.0. Is your theory that this should stick to changes that require user code to change, and ones that aren't obvious? Like, a missing method is obvious. A behavior change may not be.",

    "body": "Yea, I just quickly skimmed so that I can leave this page non empty. For migration guide, I think we should mention something that's not a corner case and when both previous and new behaviours make sense. My thought was that basically bug fixes or minor behaviour changes shouldn't come here",
