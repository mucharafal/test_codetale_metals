    "body": "nit: I've seen that in some places we import breeze types as `DenseMatrix => DBM, DenseVector => DBV` and in others we import `DenseMatrix => BDM, DenseVector => BDV`. Perhaps we can pick a convention and stick to it. Already in mllib-local/Vectors.scala we use `BD*`, so I'd lean that way. But a very minor nit :)\n",
