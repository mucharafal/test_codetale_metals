Since in case of colon we ensure no space before it and exactly one space after it.\nfor example \n\n``` scala\nval a: Int = 1 // valid\nval b : Int = 1 //Invalid\nval c:Int = 1 //Invalid\nval c :Int = 1 //Invalid\n```\n\nAlso there is a separate check for keywords. https://github.com/ScrapCodes/scalastyle/commit/cccb6b6d8e04521daa8af7e4f8c0e0bb35606f22\n",
