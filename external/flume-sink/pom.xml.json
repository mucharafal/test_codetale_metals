    "body": "The sink will be deployed to a Flume agent and not within the spark application. Adding it in external/flume would require that all of the spark dependencies be bundled with the jar, while keeping this module separate (which does not depend on the rest of Spark) allows the user to simply deploy this jar to the Flume plugins directory. In fact, this module does not have any dependencies that Flume already does not pull in by default.\n",
