    "body": "Hi Mario, I am following what Hadoop did when it was doing something similar. See NewHadoopRDD, for example. I am actually pretty flexible about the name so if folks disagree and have a better name to suggest, I am totally down for that. I just don't want to rename over and over again, so I'd suggest keeping the name the way it is right now, and get a consensus on what, if any, the new name should be. Once we have it here, I can change it.\n",
