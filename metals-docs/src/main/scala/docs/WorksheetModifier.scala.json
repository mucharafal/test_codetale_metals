The default for this\n+             |is:\n+             |```vim\n+             |nmap <Leader>ws <Plug>(coc-metals-expand-decoration)\n+             |```\n+             |\"\"\".stripMargin\n+      case _ =>\n+        \"as a comment as the end of the line.\" -> \"hover on the comment to expand.\"\n+    }\n+\n+    s\"\"\"|## Worksheets\n+        |\n+        |Worksheets are a great way to explore an api, try out an idea, or code\n+        |up an example and quickly see the evaluated expression or result. Behind\n+        |the schens worksheets are powered by the great work done in\n+        |[mdoc](https://scalameta.org/mdoc/).\n+        |\n+        |### Getting started with Worksheets\n+        |\n+        |To get started with a worksheet you can either use the `metals.new-scala-file`\n+        |command and select *Worksheet* or create a file called `*.worksheet.sc`.\n+        |This format is important as it is what tells Metals that it's meant to be\n+        |treated as a worksheet and not just a Scala script. Where you create the\n+        |script also matters. If you'd like to use classes and values from your\n+        |project, you need to make sure the worksheet is created inside of your `src`\n+        |directory. You can still create a worksheet in other places, but you will\n+        |only have access to the standard library."
