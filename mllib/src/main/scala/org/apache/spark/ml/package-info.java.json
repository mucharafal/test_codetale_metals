    "body": "Actually FYI this annotation does not show up in ScalaDoc if it's here. I think it's better to put it on the main classes in the package, namely Pipeline, Estimator, Transformer, etc. Presumably Pipeline will be the first one people read. In Spark SQL, we have it on SQLContext and SchemaRDD.\n\nAlso, to have a package-level comment in Scala, you need to create a `package.scala` with `package object ml` in it. Take a look at Spark SQL's `package.scala`. I believe you can also add the annotation there but I'm not sure.\n",
