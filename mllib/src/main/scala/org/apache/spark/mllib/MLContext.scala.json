    "body": "Hey Xiangrui, instead of doing this through implicit conversions, I'd really prefer an object with a static method here. The reason is to have a consistent API across Java, Scala and Python. Implicit conversions are cool in Scala but will lead to different code in the other languages, and I'd really prefer for someone to learn the Spark API once in one language (or see an code snippet in any one language) and be able to apply it in the other ones.\n",
