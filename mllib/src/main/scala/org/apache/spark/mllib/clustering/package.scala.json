When mixed in together, one gets a specific BregmanPointOps object\nthat computes Bregman divergences very efficiently, caching one value per\npoint and two values per center (per your observation).  This version is\neasier to understand that the previous one.\n\nIncluded also are three different implementations of K-Means clustering: 1)\none that caches distances (CachingKMeans) 2) one that tracks which clusters\nmoved and which points are assigned to which clusters and the distance to\nthe closest cluster (TrackingKMeans); and, 3) one that recomputes all\nclusters and distances (SingleKMeans).\n\nI have found the the TrackingKMeans clusterer has the best performance on\nlast data sets.\n\nI have also found that maintaining cluster centers in homogeneous\ncoordinates is more efficient than using inhomogeneous coordinates for\nmoderate to high dimensional data. There is no penalty for low dimensional\ndata.\n\nIf/when you include such changes in Spark, I would appreciate being\nincluded in the list of contributors.\n\nRegards,\n\nDerrick Burns\n\nOn Sun, Jan 11, 2015 at 10:52 AM, Derrick Burns derrickrburns@gmail.com\nwrote:\n\n> I'm willing to take one last crack at contributing the Bregman\n> modifications to Spark.

What do you mean by `arbitrary functions`? If the target is to improve k-means, we only need to implement BLAS ops required by k-means.\n\n> 2) definition of PointOps trait and various implementations for different divergences\n> 3) rewrite of clusterer to use PointOps trait but only using the squared Euclidean distance implementation\n> 4) generalization of clustering interface to select different divergences.\n\nSounds good.\n\n> 5) store seeds\n\nThis is already covered in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/3610, which is almost ready to merge.\n\n> 6) maintain exactly K clusters by splitting clusters heuristicly.\n\nWe had an example in `StreamingKMeans`. But if we want to support different distances, we need to consider how to keep the new centers inside the domain.\n\nThanks for improving your implementation! Before we merge features one by one, it would be nice to maintain your implementation as a 3rd-party Spark package (spark-packages.org). That helps people find it and send feedbacks.\n",
