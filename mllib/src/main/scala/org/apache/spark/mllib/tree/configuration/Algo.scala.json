    "body": "The various `Enumeration` classes in `mllib.tree.configuration` package are neat. A uniform _design pattern_ for parameters and options should be used for MLLib and Spark, and this could be a start. Alternatively, if there is an existing pattern in use, it should be followed for decision tree as well.\n",
