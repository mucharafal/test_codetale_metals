    "body": "You're right that they are a bit different; I was thinking in terms of thresholding for classification, but it would be important to sum, not average, for regression.  I also revoke what I said about supporting things like median.\nThis is making me vote for removing EnsembleCombiningStrategy and only supporting sum.  Do you have a use case for average?  (Sorry for the confusion!)\n",
