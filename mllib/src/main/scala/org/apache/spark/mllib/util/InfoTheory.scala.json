    "body": "I placed it in `utils` because the intention is to implement functions of Information Theory that can be used in any algorithm. For instance, the implemented `entropy` functions work out the entropy for a variable whose values have the frequencies stored in `freqs`. This is a general function that is used in the discretizer, but can be potentially used in more cases.\n\nIf you don't agree with this, there'll be no problem to move it to `discretizer` package.\n",

    "body": "We can make a different PR and discuss the design for information theory. Mixing it with the current PR would certainly delay the review process. For example, we need to discuss whether `entropy(Seq[Int])` is a proper interface. What if we want to compute entropy of `Seq[Double]`? So please try to make the number of public interfaces as few as possible.\n",

So at least you are doing some probabilistic inference of the frequencies, they should be integers. But I agree that it would be better for `InfoTheory` to have an own PR. For now, I'm going to place it under `discretization` package, as you suggested.\n",
