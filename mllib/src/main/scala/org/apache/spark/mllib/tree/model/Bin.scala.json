    "body": "`Bin` class can be simplified and some members renamed. The `lowSplit`, `highSplit` can be simplified to the single threshold corresponding to the left end of the bin range. This can be named to `leftEnd` or `lowEnd`.\n\nIt's not clear this class is needed at first place. For categorical variables, the value itself is the bin index, and for continuous variables, bins are simply defined by candidate thresholds, in turn defined by quanties. For every feature id, one can maintain a list of categories and thresholds and be done. In that case, for continuous features, the position of the threshold is the bin index.\n",
