    "body": "I want to compare with libFM, but randomly generate a binary dataset, FM can't fit the dataset perfectly. Generally, I get very small loss value, but the parameters are not exactly same every time (also in libFM).\r\n\r\nMy current test method is that for mse to generate a feature-interaction dataset by bias/linearVector/factorMatrix, FMRegressor needs to fit this dataset perfectly, bias/linearVector needs same with real bias/linearVector, every `<v_i, v_j>` needs same that calculates by factorMatrix.\r\n\r\nHowever, for FMClassifier, it is difficult to generate a binary feature-interaction dataset, so for the FMClassifier, I don't verify the correctness of interaction logic (that is verify in mse), only verify the correctness of logloss logic.",

    "body": "I still doubt whether existing testsuite is enough. \r\n1, I suggest to add several testsuites to check whether `FMClassifier` and `FMRegressor` can learn the intercept correctly. \r\nLike '// Test if we can correctly learn Y = 0.1 + 1.2*X1 - 1.3*X2 + 20*X1*X2' in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/5591/files\r\n\r\n2, I suggest to add some testcases with `fitBias==false` or/and `fitLinear==false`\r\n",
