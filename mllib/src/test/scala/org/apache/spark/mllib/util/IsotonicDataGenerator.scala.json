    "body": "Actually I thought about it and I believe the whole class is not needed. It was following example of LinearDataGenerator or KMeansDataGenerator. But since it was moved to test and it is not used anywhere else (and not planned to be used) I have removed the object and moved the methods to be private in tests where they are used.\n",
