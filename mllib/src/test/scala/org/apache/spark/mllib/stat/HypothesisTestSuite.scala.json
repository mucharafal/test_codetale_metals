    "body": "The edge case of partitions with no elements does indeed exist, which is why we have that odd check for whether a result after folding in a partition matches the initial accumulator. The test involving `nonOverlap1P` and `nonOverlap2P` should test for situations where a partition has only 1 sample. I'll break these out into separate tests, since they probably deserve to be singled out.\n",
