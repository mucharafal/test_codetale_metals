I didn't see other uses of this file anyway. Since you suggest an extension to this comma-based format, is it something known that needs to be preserved rather than changed? What about changing `lpsa.data` then?\n",

Comma can be used as label delimiter, for multi-label classification, where an example may have multiple labels.
