So if assembly is built with -Phive option then hive dependency is added to repl, so that hive is available in class path for repl.\nIf assembly is built without -Phive option then dependency is not added and the testcase is ignored. Testcase also checks runtime if hiveContext class is available, if not testcase is ignored.\nI have manually tested both the cases of building with -Phive and without hive. It will not impact assembly creation.\n",
