Really these would appear in the binary distribution of Spark if anywhere. If we are going to distribute a binary release based on Hadoop 3.2 / Hive 2.3, and I'm guessing we must, then yeah these `compile` scope deps should be listed, and technically we need to add their `NOTICE` contents to our `NOTICE` file. I can talk to you about ways to do that if necessary.\r\n\r\nAs a sanity check, do all of those `compile` scope dependencies look like they are directly needed by Spark?",
