I'd actually favor moving the [Contributing to Spark](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/SPARK/Contributing+to+Spark) page entirely out of the wiki and into here. \n\nI believe Spark accepts contributions entirely through GitHub, so it makes sense to have the contributing instructions live here.\n",
