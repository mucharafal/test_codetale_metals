We should not increase the burden.\r\n> We really don't want to support versions of Hadoop separately.\r\n\r\nSo, my question is `Apache Spark 3.0 is going to test with Hadoop 3.0 and Hadoop 3.1` in the community in Jenkins? This PR will ignore them and move forward to 3.2. That's the reason I prefer `hadoop-3.2`. Intuitively, I expected this PR will change `hadoop-3.1` to `Hadoop-3.2`.\r\n\r\nWe can keep `hadoop-3.2` for Hadoop 3.3 (if there is no problem at Hadoop 3.2 library on Hadoop 3.0). That is our approach with `hadoop-2.7` profile.",
