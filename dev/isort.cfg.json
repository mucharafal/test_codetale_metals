    "body": "No, this is not pep8 related!\n\nI deleted dev/tox.ini and created a new file dev/isort.cfg from scratch. But the fact is git \"finds\" file renames based on content similarities, so it sees this as a file rename. Actually, I did deleted the tox.ini in another commit than the commit that creates isort.ini (see https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/14567/commits), so I guess this \"visualisation\" of a file renaming comes from github\n",

    "body": "Hm, really, it guesses at moves? OK, if the net effect is that `tox.ini` has been deleted, OK. If you wouldn't mind, if you make another pass here, just add back those spaces. They seem to be present in the 'canonical' text of the license and best to just avoid any minor deviation regardless of where it came from.\n\nSo the `lint-python` script still works with this I take it because I see you updated it, and that's the important thing.\n",
