    "body": "Quick question: why do you need to run twice with different profiles? AFAIK the set of source files should be the same under all of the Hadoop profiles, so I don't think we need to set `-Phadoop-2.2` here.\n\nWhy can't we just use one Maven run with the profiles `-Pkinesis-asl -Phive -Phive-thriftserver -Pyarn`?\n",

    "body": "I didn't actually observe any differences between the two profiles in terms of Checkstyle warnings, but decided to add the second run just to be thorough.\n\nMy reasoning was that since some profiles omit some of the modules, we need to exercise all of the possible ones, even though at the moment the set of Java sources may be the same. In any case, this only adds a few seconds to the build - negligible compared to the overall `run-tests` time.\n",
