    "body": "- tox.ini kind of becames this pep8rc, indeed.\n- isort only deals with sorting \"import\" statement, not checked by pep8, but pylint has some checks on it\n- style.yapf.ini is the configuration for yapf, which is a more aggressive version of 'autopep8' made by google for their chrominum projects, to strictly format all their python files. I don't recommend to enforce the usage of it, but if one want to use it on its python file in the Spark project, he can execute it and review the style before commiting. In an ideal wold, this would be a mandatory formatting (on post commit hook for example), but this may take some times before reaching this point\n- .editorconfig only deals with tab space, like I said, might be put outside of this PR if you want\n\nI am not sure if yapf can sort imports like isort do\n",
