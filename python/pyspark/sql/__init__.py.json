I think we've discussed this before w.r.t other standard library naming conflicts, but isn't this only a problem if you're trying to import PySpark SQL's `types` module via a relative import rather than absolute one, or if you place the `python/pyspark/sql` folder directly onto your PYTHONPATH?  Is this only a problem during tests?\n",

    "body": "Ah, I think I remember the issue: I think that Python places the main file's enclosing directory onto the Python path to enable relative imports, so I guess that `python/pyspark/sql` ends up on the PYTHONPATH when we directly execute its files in run-tests.  We had a sort of messy hack for dealing with this earlier, but the file rename here also seems fine so let's go ahead and keep it.\n",
