    "body": "I'm not sure we can combine `LocalStreamingContext` and `LocalJavaStreamingContext`, as\r\n\r\n1. LocalJavaStreamingContext relies on `junit`, whereas scala test suites rely on `scalatest`. I'm not sure both can be co-used.\r\n2. LocalStreamingContext has to be a trait to co-use with SparkFunSuite (or its descendant) which many test suites are relying on.\r\n2. It may bring more changes, as `LocalJavaStreamingContext` just initializes JavaStreamingContext in `setUp` whereas Scala test suites initialize StreamingContext when they need it - flexible with how to initialize StreamingContext. If we combine twos into one, the approach `LocalStreamingContext` is doing is the way to go, and we would need to modify existing Java UTs to reflect the change.\r\n\r\nAs I commented before that we no longer need StreamingTestUtils, I guess we're addressing first question now. Please let me know there's something we can apply more.",
