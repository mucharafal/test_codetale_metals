    "body": "This is more of a personal request since this is related to work I'm doing in another bug; but it would be nice to have these packages be `o.a.s.status.api.v1.streaming`, for example. I'll need to move these classes out of this module as part of the work I'm doing and that would avoid having to change package names at that time.",

    "body": "actually I think we need to have some discussion on this\r\nthe reason I create the package org.apache.spark.streaming.status.api.v1 is because we already have the package o.a.s.streaming.ui\r\nthe web interface of streaming seems separate from the spark-core web ui\r\nso i think the api of streaming should do the same.\r\n\r\nso it depend on is this api belong to v1\r\nor is this api belong to v1 of streaming?",

    "body": "I'd rather keep UI vs. API as separate things.\r\n\r\nIt makes sense to make the APIs behave as a cohesive thing. For example, as I mention later, having \"/api/v1/applications\" and \"/streaming/api/v1/\" is not good at all. We should just have \"/api/v1/applications/:id/:attempt/streaming\".\r\n\r\nThe UI code doesn't really have the same needs and it doesn't really matter much where it lives. Although with the changes I'm working on it would also be moved to a different module and maybe package.",
